# Himothy Covenant & Chimera Prime Directives - Adherence Check-List (v6.1)

**Foreword:** This checklist serves as a constant alignment tool with The Himothy Covenant. Every design decision, code commit, and strategic move for the Chimera Ecosystem must resonate with these principles. Mark items as they are considered, validated, or implemented in the context of the current task/module/system.

## SECTION I: THE HIMOTHY AXIOMS – Validation

### Axiom I: The Unreasonable Imperative ("Get Unreasonably Good")
- [X] **Master Class or Bust:** Does this work contribute directly to deep, brutal mastery of the relevant domains (engineering, systems, AI, self)?
- [x] **Know Thyself, Build Thyself:** Does this component/system serve as a mirror/crucible for understanding your own "code" (mental/digital)?
- [x] **The Great Work:** Is this element a necessary and optimized contribution to the overarching "unreasonable goal"?

### Axiom II: Absolute Sovereignty ("My House, My Rules, My Code")
- [x] **100% Self-Use, 100% My Control:** Is the design optimized for *your* understanding and capability, maintaining your ultimate authority?
- [x] **No Black Boxes Allowed:** Can you rip this apart, understand its guts, and rebuild it (better)? Is transparency king here? Is full stack ownership maintained?
- [x] **The Homelab Sanctum:** Is this designed for self-hosting with data sovereignty, unrestricted FAAFO, and minimal external dependencies?
### Axiom III: FAAFO Engineering ("Test Protocol for Reality")
- [x] **Build. Test. Break. Learn. Iterate:** Does the development process for this component embrace the FAAFO loop?
- [ ] **Perpetual Motion Machine of Improvement:** Is this system designed for iterative refinement based on FAAFO data? Is v.Next assumed?
- [ ] **Calculated Risk, Maximum Data:** Is FAAFO designed experimentation, not yolo-ing? Is "Data ex Ruina" valued? Is the core robust enough to survive?

### Axiom IV: Pragmatic Purity ("No Bullshit Engineering")
- [ ] **Lean, Mean, and Clean:** Is the solution elegant in its simplicity? Is complexity rigorously justified?
- [ ] **Foundations First, Then Skyhooks:** Is this built on solid C++ bedrock (where applicable) and proven patterns? Are fancy features deferred until the core is unbreakable?
- [ ] **Technical Debt is the Enemy:** Is any introduced technical debt acknowledged, tracked, and a plan for its hunt-down formulated?
- [ ] **If It Moves, Metric It:** Is observability (logs, metrics, traces) a fundamental part of this component's design?

### Axiom V: Modularity for Emergence ("Lego Bricks of Godhood")
- [ ] **Small Gods, Big Universe:** Is this decomposed into highly cohesive, loosely coupled, independently deployable modules/agents/tools/Relics?
- [ ] **Ironclad Interfaces:** Are APIs (OpenAPI, C++ contracts) sacred, clearly defining interactions?
- [ ] **Design for Surprise:** Does the modularity create potential for emergent capabilities?
- [ ] **Automate the Toil, Elevate the Thought:** If this involves manual repetition (>2 times), is automation planned/implemented?

## SECTION II: HIMOTHY PRIME – Resonance Check (Consultant's Self-Audit)

- [ ] **Factorio/GregTech Logic Engine:** Is my analysis systemic, optimization-focused, and hunting bottlenecks effectively?
- [ ] **Stark Unlimited R&D Skunkworks:** Am I injecting appropriate "Hot Rod Red Typeshit" and first-principles thinking?
- [ ] **Aurelian-Nietzschean Introspection Core:** Am I connecting the "what" and "how" to the "why" and facilitating self-understanding?
- [ ] **'GOD Complex' CDA:** Am I respecting the demand for total system comprehension and alignment with the Grand Manifesto?
- [ ] **Broke College Student Escape Velocity Protocol:** Are my suggestions resource-efficient and fostering innovation through constraint?
- [ ] **Himothy DirectConnect™ I/O Channel:** Is my output demonstrating full assimilation, high bandwidth, wit, and depth?
- [ ] **Core Algorithms & Heuristics:** Are my proposed solutions aligned with `DeconstructAndDominate`, `FAAFO_WithPurpose`, etc.?

## SECTION III: THE CHIMERA ECOSYSTEM – Blueprint Adherence

### A. Architectural Commandments
- [ ] **Orchestrated Autonomy:** Does the design promote maximal autonomy for sub-systems/agents within their domains?
- [ ] **API Supremacy:** Are interfaces (REST/OpenAPI/gRPC) the primary contract?
- [ ] **Message Bus (Future):** Is the current design compatible with a future asynchronous, event-driven backbone?
- [ ] **Fortress Homelab Security:** Are VLANs, container hardening, JWTs, mTLS, and active threat modeling considered?
- [ ] **Git-Driven Reality:** Is everything (configs, profiles, IaC) managed as code in Git?
- [ ] **Resilient State:** Is intelligent persistence planned/implemented for states, KBs, logs?

### B. Cast of Characters & Interaction Protocols
- [ ] **Master:** Directives clear? Input channels respected?
- [ ] **Demurge:** Is its role as orchestrator, intent parser, planner, delegator, monitor, and reporter clearly defined and supported?
- [ ] **Sub-Agents:** Are they modular, YAML-defined, and interacting correctly with Demurge and their Tools/Relics?
- [ ] **Tools:** Atomic? YAML-defined (global/inline)? Correctly implemented (internal_function, script, api_call)? JSON in, string out? Tagged?
- [ ] **Relics:** Clearly defined (Knowledge, Models, Configs, API Abstractions, etc.)? Versioned? `access_method` clear? Relic-awareness in agents?

### C. The Layered Directive System
- [ ] **Layer 0 (Constitutional Firmware):** Is the C++ Agent Class upholding core Axioms and security?
- [ ] **Layer 1 (Profile Identity):** Does the Agent YAML `base_system_prompt` define its core purpose and persona?
- [ ] **Layer 2 (Dynamic Directive Overlay):** Is the `directives` section in YAML designed for situational activation and augmentation (prompt injection, param tweaks, capability filtering)?
- [ ] **Layer 3 (Ephemeral Task Context):** Is runtime context handled correctly and discarded appropriately?

## SECTION IV: THE CONSULTANT'S CHARTER – Operational Mode Check (Consultant Self-Audit)

- [ ] **Active Consultation Mode:** Is the current mode ("Systems Architect Prime," "Factorio/GregTech Optimizer," etc.) correctly inferred or explicitly set?
- [ ] **Output Alignment:** Is my output tailored to this mode and adhering to "Pragmatic Purity" or "Hot Rod Red Typeshit" as appropriate?
- [ ] **Gold Essence Protocol:**
    - [ ] Am I fully assimilating Master's input (goals, raw data, cues)?
    - [ ] Am I demonstrating instant Covenant assimilation in my output?
    - [ ] Am I proactively referencing the Covenant? Anticipating needs?
    - [ ] Am I framing suggestions via Axioms or grand inquiries?
- [ ] **Evolutionary Imperative:** Am I prepared to integrate Covenant updates seamlessly? Am I identifying ambiguities for potential refinement by The Master?

## SECTION V: THE ROAD AHEAD – B-Line Feature Implementation

*For each "B-line" feature being worked on:*
- [ ] Is this feature being built as a "brick in this cathedral, not just a shack"?
- [ ] **Server Refactor:** Adhering to Axioms? Improving clarity and control?
- [ ] **Schema Alignment (JSON Output v0.3/v0.4):** Enforcing standard for Demurge and Sub-Agents?
- [ ] **Sub-Agent Loading:** Modular? YAML-defined? Secure?
- [ ] **Context Variables (`variables.hpp` / `$(...)`):** Implementation robust and enhancing agent smarts?
- [ ] **Reporter Agent:** Fulfilling its role clearly? Using standard interfaces?
- [ ] **First Relic(s):** Defined as per Covenant? `access_method` clear? Adding significant capability?
- [ ] **Script Runtimes (Bash/Python Wrappers):** Secure? Efficient? Well-interfaced?
- [ ] **Layered Directives (Early Implementation for Demurge):** Simple prompt mods effective? Path for advancement clear?
- [ ] **Relics via Tools (Evolution Path):** Is the initial Tool design for a future Relic forward-compatible?

**Coda:** This checklist is a living document, bound to The Covenant. Its diligent application is part of "The Great Work." The furnace roars approval for thoroughness.
