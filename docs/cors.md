**1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

*   **The Problem: Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**
    *   Web browsers enforce a security rule called the Same-Origin Policy. By default, a web page loaded from one "origin" (defined by protocol (http/https), domain, and port) cannot make requests to a *different* origin.
    *   In your setup:
        *   The **Frontend** (dashboard) is likely served from somewhere like `http://localhost:8000` (during local development) or `https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com` (as configured in your server).
        *   The **Backend** (your C++ agent server) is running at `http://<server-ip>:7777`.
    *   Since the origin of the frontend (e.g., `https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com:443` - HTTPS default port is 443) is different from the origin of the backend (`http://<server-ip>:7777`), the browser will block the frontend's JavaScript (`app.js`) from directly calling the `/prompt` endpoint on the backend *unless* the backend explicitly permits it.

*   **The Solution: CORS Headers**
    *   CORS is a mechanism using HTTP headers that tells the browser it's okay for a frontend from one origin to access resources on a backend from a different origin.
    *   Your server needs to send specific `Access-Control-*` headers in its responses.

*   **How Your Code Implements CORS:**
    *   **Preflight Request (`OPTIONS`):** For requests that are considered "non-simple" (like your `POST` request with `Content-Type: application/json`), the browser first sends an `OPTIONS` request to the server endpoint (`/prompt`). This is called a "preflight" request. It asks the server "Hey, is it okay if a script from origin X tries to send a POST request with these headers?".
        *   Your code handles this correctly:
            ```c++
            svr.Options("/prompt", [](const httplib::Request &, httplib::Response &res) {
                // Which frontend origins are allowed?
                res.set_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com");
                // Which headers can the frontend send in the *actual* request?
                res.set_header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type");
                // Which methods are allowed for the *actual* request?
                res.set_header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST, OPTIONS");
                res.status = 204; // Standard success for preflight
                serverLog("REQUEST", "OPTIONS /prompt (CORS preflight)");
            });
            ```
        *   The browser checks this `OPTIONS` response. If the origin, method, and headers match what the frontend wants to do, it proceeds to the actual request. Otherwise, it blocks the request and shows a CORS error in the console.

    *   **Actual Request (`POST`):** If the preflight is successful (or if the request was "simple" and didn't need a preflight), the browser sends the actual `POST` request. Crucially, the server *still* needs to include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the response to this `POST` request as well.
        *   Your code handles this too:
            ```c++
            svr.Post("/prompt", [&](const httplib::Request &req, httplib::Response &res) {
                // MUST include this again in the actual response!
                res.set_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com");

                // ... (rest of your POST handler logic) ...

                res.status = 200;
                res.set_content(responseBody, "application/json");
                serverLog("RESPONSE", "Sent 200 OK for /prompt");
            });
            ```

    *   **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` Value:**
        *   `"https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com"`: This is specific and secure. Only frontend code served from exactly this origin can talk to your backend.
        *   `"http://localhost:8000"`: You had this commented out. You'd use this during local development if your frontend dev server runs on port 8000.
        *   `"*"`: (Wildcard) Allows *any* origin. This is generally **not recommended for production** as it disables the SOP protection, but can be useful for quick testing or truly public APIs. Your code currently *doesn't* use the wildcard.

**2. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**

*   **What it is:** HTTPS is essentially the standard HTTP protocol layered on top of an encryption layer, usually TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
*   **What it Provides:**
    *   **Encryption:** Protects the data exchanged between the browser and the server from eavesdropping (confidentiality). Anyone intercepting the traffic only sees scrambled data.
    *   **Authentication:** Allows the browser to verify the identity of the server it's talking to using the server's SSL/TLS certificate. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks where someone pretends to be your server.
    *   **Integrity:** Ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with during transit.
*   **Why it's Important:** Essential for any communication involving sensitive data (logins, personal info, API keys if sent directly). Modern browsers increasingly push for HTTPS everywhere and flag HTTP sites as "Not Secure".
*   **How Your Code Handles It (Currently It Doesn't):**
    *   Your code uses `httplib::Server svr;`. This creates a standard **HTTP** server.
    *   It listens on port 7777 using plain HTTP.
*   **How to Implement HTTPS with `httplib.h`:**
    1.  **Get Certificates:** You need an SSL/TLS certificate and a corresponding private key.
        *   **Options:**
            *   **Let's Encrypt:** Free, automated, and widely trusted certificates (recommended for production). Requires a domain name and running an ACME client (like Certbot) to obtain and renew certificates.
            *   **Commercial CA:** Purchase certificates from providers like DigiCert, Comodo, etc.
            *   **Self-Signed:** Generate your own certificate. Free and easy for testing/local development, but browsers will show a security warning because it's not trusted by a recognized Certificate Authority (CA). You'd have to manually tell your browser/client to trust it.
        *   **Files:** You typically get two `.pem` files (or similar formats):
            *   `server.crt` (or `fullchain.pem`): The public certificate (and possibly intermediate certificates).
            *   `server.key` (or `privkey.pem`): The private key (keep this secure!).
    2.  **Use `httplib::SSLServer`:** Change your server creation line:
        ```c++
        // Replace this:
        // httplib::Server svr;

        // With this:
        #ifdef CPPHTTPLIB_OPENSSL_SUPPORT // Check if OpenSSL support is compiled in
        // Provide paths to your certificate and key files
        httplib::SSLServer svr("./path/to/your/server.crt", "./path/to/your/server.key");

        // Check if the server was initialized correctly (e.g., files found, valid)
        if (!svr.is_valid()) {
            serverLog("FATAL", "Failed to initialize SSLServer. Check certificate paths/validity.");
            // Include OpenSSL error details if possible: ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
            return 1;
        }
        #else
        serverLog("FATAL", "Server compiled without OpenSSL support, cannot run HTTPS.");
        // You might fall back to HTTP or exit
        // httplib::Server svr; // Or just exit
         return 1;
        #endif
        ```
    3.  **Port:** Typically, you would listen on port **443** for HTTPS:
        ```c++
        const int port = 443; // Default HTTPS port
        // ...
        if (!svr.listen(host.c_str(), port)) { /* ... */ }
        ```
        If you use a non-standard port (like 7777) for HTTPS, clients *must* specify it in the URL (e.g., `https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com:7777`).
    4.  **Compile with OpenSSL:** The `httplib.h` library needs to be used in a project compiled and linked with OpenSSL development libraries. Your `Makefile` seems to link `-lcurl -ljsoncpp -pthread`. You would need to add flags to link against OpenSSL (like `-lssl -lcrypto`).

**Connecting CORS and HTTPS:**

*   Using HTTPS **does not** remove the need for CORS if the frontend and backend are still on different origins.
*   If your frontend is at `https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com` and your backend is at `https://your-backend-domain.com:7777` (note different domain or port), you *still* need the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers from the backend, even though both are HTTPS.
*   The only way to avoid CORS is to serve both the frontend files and the backend API from the *exact same origin* (same protocol, same domain, same port).

**In Summary for Your Code:**

1.  Your server is currently **HTTP**.
2.  It correctly implements **CORS** headers to allow requests specifically from `https://test.clevo.ddnsgeek.com`.
3.  The CORS implementation handles the necessary preflight (`OPTIONS`) request for your frontend's `POST` call.
4.  To switch to **HTTPS**, you need to:
    *   Obtain SSL certificate/key files.
    *   Change `httplib::Server` to `httplib::SSLServer` and provide the file paths.
    *   Ensure your project is compiled and linked with OpenSSL.
    *   Consider using port 443 or ensure the frontend uses the correct port in the HTTPS URL.
5.  Remember that CORS headers will likely still be needed even after switching to HTTPS if the frontend origin differs from the backend origin.
