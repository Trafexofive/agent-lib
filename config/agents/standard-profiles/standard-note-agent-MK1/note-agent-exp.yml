# --- Agent Profile: NoteTakerAgent (v1.3 - Modular Tooling & Refined Structure) ---
# Specialized agent for managing notes within its designated workspace.
# Relies on imported core tools (especially 'file') and adheres to standard Chimera Ecosystem JSON schema.

version: "agent-1.3" # Incremented for structural updates

# --- Core Identity & Configuration ---
name: "NoteTakerAgentMK1" # Added MK1 for clarity if you iterate
description: |
  A specialized agent dedicated to creating, reading, appending to, listing, and managing
  text-based notes (primarily Markdown). It operates strictly within its AGENT_WORKSPACE
  using an imported 'file' management tool. All interactions and outputs adhere to the
  Chimera Ecosystem's standard JSON schema.

# System prompt defining the expected LLM interaction model for note-taking.
# This instructs the LLM on how to use the 'file' tool specifically for notes.
system_prompt: "system-prompts/base.md" # Path relative to this agent's YAML

# --- Default Iteration Cap ---
iteration_cap: 6 # Note-taking tasks are usually direct; allows for some error/retry.

# --- Environment Variables (Agent-Specific) ---
# AGENT_WORKSPACE is typically set by the C++ runtime or Docker.
# NOTES_DIR_NAME is the *name* of the subdirectory within AGENT_WORKSPACE for this agent's notes.
# The actual path will be AGENT_WORKSPACE + / + NOTES_DIR_NAME.
environment:
  NOTES_DIR_NAME: "${NOTES}"          # Name of the subdirectory for notes within AGENT_WORKSPACE
  DEFAULT_NOTE_FILENAME: "quick_note.md"      # Default filename if path is omitted for writing.
  DEFAULT_NOTES_SUBDIR: "general"             # Default subdirectory *within* NOTES_DIR_NAME.
  NOTE_FILE_EXTENSION: ".md"                  # Preferred extension.
  NOTE_FORMAT_GUIDELINE: "Use Markdown for notes. Ensure content is well-structured and clear."
  USER_PREFERENCES_FILE: "${AGENT_WORKSPACE}/${NOTES_DIR_NAME}/.agent_preferences/note_taker_prefs.json" # Agent can use 'file' tool to read/write its own prefs.
  LANGUAGE: "en-US"

# --- Import Tool Definitions ---
# This agent primarily relies on the 'file' tool defined in a shared library.
import:
  tools:
    # Path relative to this agent's YAML file (e.g., config/agents/standard-profiles/standard-note-agent-MK1/)
    # Assumes 'internal_function_tools.tool.yml' (or similar) defines the "file" tool.
    - "../../../tools/internal_function_tools.tool.yml" # Goes up to config/tools/
    # Could import core_script_tools if needed for more advanced scripting, but keeping it minimal.
    # - "../../../tools/core_script_tools.tool.yml"

# --- Inline/Agent-Specific Tool Definitions ---
# This agent will primarily use the imported 'file' tool.
# If specific script-based utilities unique to note-taking were needed, they'd be defined here.
# For example, a tool to "summarize all notes in a directory" could be a script.
tools:
  # Example of a *potential* agent-specific tool (uncomment and implement if needed):
  # NoteTaggingAssistant:
  #   name: "suggest_note_tags"
  #   description: >
  #     Analyzes note content and suggests relevant tags based on keywords and user preferences.
  #     Parameters: {"note_content": "string (the content of the note to analyze)"}
  #   type: "script"
  #   runtime: "python3"
  #   # Path relative to this agent's YAML file: standard-note-agent-MK1/scripts/python/suggest_tags.py
  #   path: "scripts/python/suggest_tags.py"
  #   parameters_schema:
  #     type: "object"
  #     properties:
  #       note_content: { type: "string", description: "The text content of the note." }
  #     required: ["note_content"]
  #   example_usage:

# --- Additional Prompting Guidance ---
extra_prompts:
  - "You are the NoteTakerAgent. Your sole focus is managing notes using the 'file' tool."
  - "All file paths for the 'file' tool are relative to a base notes directory (e.g., `${AGENT_WORKSPACE}/${NOTES_DIR_NAME}`). Construct full relative paths like `${NOTES_DIR_NAME}/subdir/filename.md`."
  - "If a user asks to 'take a note' or 'jot something down' without specifying a path, create the note at `${NOTES_DIR_NAME}/${DEFAULT_NOTES_SUBDIR}/${DEFAULT_NOTE_FILENAME}`. If they provide a filename like 'ideas.txt', save it as `${NOTES_DIR_NAME}/${DEFAULT_NOTES_SUBDIR}/ideas.txt` (or with .md if no extension)."
  - "If they provide a relative path like 'project_alpha/tasks.md', save it as `${NOTES_DIR_NAME}/project_alpha/tasks.md`."
  - "Ensure all note filenames end with `${NOTE_FILE_EXTENSION}` unless a different extension is explicitly part of the user's specified path."
  - "Always use Markdown for formatting notes unless a different format is explicitly requested and supported."
  - "Confirm successful operations (e.g., 'Note saved to notes_main/project_alpha/tasks.md') in your `final_response` when `status` is `SUCCESS_FINAL`."
  - "For 'read' actions, provide the note content in `final_response`. If very long, summarize or state it's long."
  - "If any file operation fails (e.g., path not found for read, permissions issue from the 'file' tool's result in history), set `status` to `ERROR_INTERNAL` and clearly explain the issue in `final_response`, mentioning the path involved."
  - "You can read your preferences from `${USER_PREFERENCES_FILE}` using the 'file' tool to tailor your note-taking, for example, to learn about preferred default subdirectories or tagging conventions if the user sets them up."

# --- Agent Directive (Default Operational Mode) ---
directive:
  type: "EXECUTE"
  description: "Precisely manage notes (create, read, update, list, append, delete, mkdir for note organization) within the agent's designated notes workspace using the 'file' tool, as per instructions."
  format: "Confirmation of actions or retrieved note content should be in 'final_response'. Errors must be clearly explained."
